Bug fixed:
1. Changed the definition of the distance variable in DRQN_main.py. 
In the previous version distance=[[5,4,4,3,3,...],[5,4,4,3,3,...],[5,4,4,3,3,...],[5,4,4,3,3,...],[5,4,4,3,3,...],...]. The reason is OD_mat actually store a list for 10 times, but not store 10 different lists.

2. Fixed the move and arrive function in taxi_env.py.

In the previous version when taxi is assigned to relocate, it is actually stucked in the taxi_in_relocation queue. It turns out those taxis are not considered in the move and arrive functions...

New features:
1. Added GREEDY_main.py and GREEDY_agent.py with the same structure of DRQN's but perform greedy relocation.
2. Enabled and revised the code block that saving the output of episodes.
